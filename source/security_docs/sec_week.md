# Security Weeks at Status

We at Status not only push our application to decentralization, but we also strive to make the organization itself decentralized as well.  This affects how organizational security is done, and is illustrated by the following quote:

> What do we protect if there is no castle?

As something is further decentralized, the associated security risks and responsibilities are pushed towards the edges; with organizations, that means that the contributors to he project hold the majority of the security risks as there is no centralized infrastructure to protect.  

The most effective way to combat this is to educate individuals about proper personal security and provide them with tooling to make good decisions.
That being said, Status will undergo a organization wide _Security Week_ to set the bar of security for both individuals and the organization.  Currently, the week is set out to perform the following tasks across the week:

- **days 1-2:**
    - establish channels of communication and ground rules for what theyâ€™re used for
    - initiate personal procedures checklist (focused on personal property and asset management)
- **days 3-4:**
    - continue personal procedures checklist (focused on company based interaction)
- **days 5-7:**
    - initiate company-wide checklist
    - come together on company-wide practices
    - start regular interval security education series

As we ramp up and prepare, the associated guides to be used for individuals will be published on the [guides](guides_index.html) page.  Feel free to use them to boost your personal security practices, and increase your overall safety and privacy as an internet citizen.
