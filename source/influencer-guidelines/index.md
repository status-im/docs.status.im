## STATUS INFLUENCER GUIDELINES

Status believes that an influencer should always produce authentic, transparent content. That’s why Status requires all influencers, including ambassadors and affiliates, we work with to adhere to the following Status Influencer Guidelines when blogging, tweeting, posting on social media, or otherwise publishing content about Status or any of our products or services. 
It’s an influencer’s responsibility to:

- Reflect their honest opinion and actual experience in all content.

- Verify functionality of the technical details of any Status product or service before making any representation about how it works.

- Follow the Status principles found here: https://status.im/our_team/our_principles.html.

- Make full, fair, and effective disclosures of material facts of their relationship with Status. 

- Post all content in good taste and free of inappropriate language, bigotry, racism, or discrimination based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. 

- Adhere to all laws, regulations, and requirements in their jurisdiction regarding advertising, marketing, endorsements, disclosures, or other promotions related to a material relationship or financial reward. This includes whether they are considered to be an influencer or advertiser in their jurisdiction, as well as whether the promotion, contest, picture, video, or other material being posted is subject to regulation in their jurisdiction. It’s an influencer’s sole responsibility to understand such obligations. Status is not responsible for an influencer’s failure to comply with such obligations in any jurisdiction.

- Not post or share any content that violates or infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party. This includes copyright, trademark, and trade secret rights, as well as the right to use someone's name, likeness, or voice. Examples include photographs, videos, music, trademarks/logos, personal names/likenesses (including celebrities’ names/likenesses), and writings.

(“Status”) is a Singapore entity, not located in the United States of America (U.S.), that conducts global marketing campaigns but does not conduct business activities within the U.S. Status does not seek participation from any influencer with the intent to conduct business activities in the U.S., and although an influencer may be located in the U.S. (whether now or at some future time, as the case may be) an influencer shall not conduct business with, market to, or solicit sales from U.S. citizens or residents on behalf of Status. An influencer’s publishing content about Status or any of its products or services shall not subject Status or any of its officers, directors, or employees to jurisdiction in the U.S. under any circumstance. If an influencer is a U.S. citizen, an influencer may participate in and receive benefits from Status marketing programs, but such influencer is not eligible to receive Status Network Tokens (SNT). An influencer who publishes content about Status or its products and services must acknowledge that during the Status ICO, U.S. citizens and residents were not eligible to receive SNT, and if such influencer participated in such ICO, they adhered to the SNT terms and conditions which can be found at https://contribute.status.im/status-terms.pdf.
