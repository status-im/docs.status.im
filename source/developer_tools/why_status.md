# Why Status 

We’ve built this site for DApp developers to easily optimize their work and integrate it with Status. 

Before we dig in, why should you be interested in Status? To understand why Status is widely anticipated and expected to be a leading Ethereum mobile app choice, let us consider Status’ unique value proposition. 

Status combines multiple functions on a single unified platform:

1. a wallet for handling Ether and ERC-20 tokens 
2. a secure chat app using the p2p messaging protocol, Whisper
3. a DApp browser
4. a DApp store with ranking source from decentralized curation to help users find useful things to do 

Status is designed with a privacy-first focus and an emphasis on distributed systems. While many end users will not necessarily understand the subtleties of the design, they will appreciate the seamless integration, the quality of the curated DApps in the DApp store and the consistency of the user experience across all of the DApps presented there.  

These tutorials will help you confirm your DApp is ready for Status, guide you through preparation, and familiarize you with the DApp registration process. 

- [Mobile Developer Tools](run_on_status/mobile_dev_tools.html) provides context and ways to set up your development platform including mobile device emulators, simple networking and debugging tools. If you are new to mobile development, welcome, and start here. Developers who routinely focus on mobile DApps can probably skip this section. 

- [DApp Store Requirements](run_on_status/dapp_store_requirements.html) outlines must-do items for listing in Status' curated DApp Store. 

- [Implement EIP-1102](run_on_status/eip-1102.html) is the place to start if you already have a DApp and want to confirm everything will work perfectly on Status. EIP-1102 is explained in detail. In case you have wanted to implement EIP-1102 (you should) and weren’t sure how to proceed, we have you covered. 

- [Whisper &amp; QR Codes](status_extras/status_dapp_api.html) introduces Status extensions that could help you improve your DApp.

- [Register DApps](register_dapps/register_dapps.html) explains how to get your DApp listed in the DApp Store including how to get on the Top Ranked DApps list.

Figure 1: The DApp Store

The Ethereum community has long-desired a user-friendly and secure solution that would unify the front-end components of wallets, browser and secure distributed chat and ultimately welcome the masses to the world of distributed applications. The Status network of projects includes Embark, Keycard and Nimbus, and  team members contribute to many game-changing projects including Whisper and Ethereum 2.0.

Status is their solution.

We look forward to seeing your DApp in front of eager users in the integrated DApp Store. 

Welcome!
