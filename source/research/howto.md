title: Getting Started with Swarm
---

## Intro
In this tutorial we'll learn how to use Ethereum's Swarm protocol to host a simple website on Swarm. While everything happens in your console for this tutorial, you should have your console ready. you will be able to unsderstand how to setup, upload and access different kinds of files, as well as the beginnings of what it is possible to build with Swarm. 

This tutorial is intended to provide you with the skills needed to adapt Swarm to your needs. You will be larning about how to set up Swarm and use it.  


We have created this specific document specially for this tutorial. Please feel free to add additional tutorials if you would like to help the community out.

Swarm offers a DDoS-resistant peer - to - peer storage and service solution with zero downtime, fault tolerance and censorship resistance as well as self-sustainability due to an integrated incentive system that uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.Swarm offers a local HTTP proxy if installed on a machine, Which is helpful in creating Dapp's. 

Swarm is a **persistent data structure**. Persistent data structures always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. 

**HAMT - Hash Array Mapped Trie** is one of the best examples for persistent data structures, As they will preserve previous versions of itself on any updates. It is often used to implement a general purpose persistent map data structure. HAMT'S composped of `Ideal Hash Trees` which are mutable.
