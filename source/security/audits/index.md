title: Status External Audits
---

This page contains information about all the external audits we have undergone.  As we reach major milestones in development, after rounds of internal review and auditing, we reach out to third parties to verify our sanity, and double/triple check the work that we do.  

These security audits are not guarantees of security in the projects they pertain to.  They are additional checks from objective third parties to help bolster confidence in the security of intended functionality.  

As always, if you find a bug or vulnerability in our code, please report it to [security@status.im](emailto:security@status.im)
