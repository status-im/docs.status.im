# Curated DApp Store 

Status includes a DApp Store where the DApps that deliver the most value to the community rise to the top of the ranked list. Integration into Status helps new Ethereum users to quickly identify the Web3 DApps most deserving of their attention. 

The DApp list and rankings are curated by two complementary methods.

- DApps are human-reviewed to ensure they meet the essential requirements and align with Statusâ€™ core values. 
- DApps are ranked by a decentralized algorithm that uses economic incentives to give priority to the DApps that provide the most value to the Web3 community.
