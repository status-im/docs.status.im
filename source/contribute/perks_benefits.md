# All The Things!

**People**
- Work with some of the most passionate & dedicated minds in the Ethereum space. 

**Compensation**
- We ask that you're willing to be paid in a combination of fiat and cryptocurrency.
- We'll reward you with a competitive base salary.
- We'll also reward you with SNT (Status Network Tokens) to give you a real stake in the success of the organisation.
- A generous budget to choose whatever phone and laptop you prefer.
- We provide a small allowance for a co-working space, or to work from a caf√© occasionally.

**Freedom**
- Work from wherever you choose. Our contributors are a varied bunch - some work from home, some from a coworking space, some from a local cafe, others are nomads. 
- We operate an open vacation policy, meaning there are no hard limits or strict rules around how much holiday you take and how you schedule it.
- We want our contributors to be healthy and take the time they need to relax and enjoy quality disconnected time away from work.

**Travel**
 - Each contributor has a budget to attend conferences and meetups of their choice. 
 - Twice per year the whole organisation gets together to connect (in 2018, we visited Bangkok and Prague). 

**Note:** We don't offer traditional benefits like medical/dental insurance - we'd rather pay you well and give you the freedom to select your own benefits, on your terms.
