# Set Your Status! 

The beauty of Status is that any user accessing your DApp through our browser has already installed everything they need to access the Ethereum network and make transactions.

You can detect our browser by checking if `window.ethereum.isStatus` returns true.

Knowing that your users are on a mobile browser means that you can put aside any instructions about how to set up a wallet.

You can also provide Status-specific information or show our logo, if youâ€™d like. Our brand assets are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/status-im/design-guides).
