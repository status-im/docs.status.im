# Security Matters!

Welcome to the Status security section. Security is a core principle of our organization, and these pages are a collection of resources to inform you on how we put that into practice.  Security, especially in the decentralization space, is an ongoing and endless pursuit that we are dedicated to. If you find something that we should add, tell us!
